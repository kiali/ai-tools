# File Protection Rules

## Files That Should Not Be Changed

- Never change a versioned role in the operator (e.g. do not modify anything under roles/v1.73, roles/v2.4, and other roles like that).
- Never change a version of the kiali-operator manifest CSV files UNLESS it is the last version. For example, if the last version of the CSV is 2.13.0, you can change that. Change no others.
- The CRD Schema golden copies found in kiali-operator/crd-docs/crd are the source of truth, so they can be modified. Those golden copies are synced to other CRD files in other locations via the "sync-crds" make target found in the kiali-operator makefile, so never change a CRD file that is a copy of a golden file CRD Schema.

## Generated Files That Are Absolutely Forbidden To Be Changed - DO NOT MODIFY

- Never change content/en/docs/Configuration/kialis.kiali.io.md
- Never change content/en/docs/Configuration/ossmconsoles.kiali.io.md
- Always ignore _output directories and their subdirectories. Never change anything in those locations.
