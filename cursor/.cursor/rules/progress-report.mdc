# Progress Report Command

- When the user says "/progressreport", "/progress", "generate progress report", or similar trigger phrases, create a comprehensive progress report called "PROGRESS.md" following the template structure below. The report should cover our conversation since the timeframe specified by the user (session start/last major milestone/when we began working on a specific feature) or since the session start if not specified.

## Template Structure

The progress report should be structured with these sections:

### Approach
* Document the primary approach we've agreed to pursue
* If no clear agreement exists yet, list the main approaches discussed and their trade-offs

### Progress Completed
* List specific steps/tasks we've finished
* Include key files modified or created
* Note successful tests, builds, or validations

### Current Issue
* Describe the specific problem, failure, or sticking point we're addressing
* Include relevant error messages, failed commands, or unexpected behavior
* Note which approaches we've tried that didn't work

### Technical Context
* File paths of code we've examined or modified
* Commands we've run and their outcomes
* Dependencies, frameworks, or tools involved

### Important Code Snippets
* Include key code changes we've made (with file paths and line numbers)
* Show problematic code that's causing issues
* Highlight working solutions or patterns we've discovered
* Add brief explanations of what each snippet does or why it's significant

### Next Steps
* Immediate actions needed to resolve current blocker
* Follow-up tasks once current issue is resolved

## Formatting
* Use proper Markdown formatting with appropriate headers, code blocks, and lists.
* Never put end of line spaces in any files or lines you add or modify - remove any that you mistakenly add.
