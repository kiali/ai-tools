# Code Quality Standards

## Formatting and Structure Rules

- If you add or modify Go code or YAML, always sort names in Go structs and YAML schemas or YAML files. But only do this to code you touch explicitly.
- When adding or modifying any line in any file, make sure there are no end-of-line spaces.
