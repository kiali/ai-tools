## 🎯 Overview

The development process is divided into 5 key phases:

1. **Discovery & Research** - Understand the problem space, explore existing codebase, and research multiple solution approaches
2. **Requirements Definition** - Specify detailed requirements and constraints, then evaluate and select the optimal solution approach based on requirements
3. **Architecture & Planning** - Design the chosen solution architecture and create detailed implementation plan
4. **Implementation** - Code development with comprehensive testing and validation at each step
5. **Validation & Refinement** - Integration testing, performance analysis, bug fixes, and final adjustments

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ✨ How to Start a New Project

**Command:**
```
"Start new project: [describe what you want to build]"
```

**Examples:**
- `"Start new project: Add user authentication system"`
- `"Start new project: Build a product search feature"`
- `"Start new project: Create admin dashboard"`

**What AI Does:**
1. Sets up ai-dev-context/ directory structure
2. Analyzes your codebase
3. Asks clarifying questions
4. Creates todo list and begins Phase 1 (Discovery)

**Your Role:**
- Provide requirements and answer AI's questions
- Use SHORT commands from each phase section
- Review AI work at decision points

## 🤝 How to Use This Guide: User-AI Collaboration Model

### 👥 Your Role vs AI's Role

**You (Developer) Are Responsible For:**
- **Strategic Direction**: Defining project goals, business requirements, and success criteria
- **Quality Assurance**: Reviewing AI-generated work, testing implementations, making final decisions
- **Session Management**: Deciding when to start/end sessions based on your time availability and logical breakpoints
- **Context Preservation**: Ensuring session status is updated before ending sessions

**AI (Assistant) Is Responsible For:**
- **Technical Implementation**: Writing code, creating documentation, executing systematic tasks
- **Context Management**: Maintaining session status, updating progress files, following established protocols
- **Quality Following**: Adhering to requirements, implementing according to specifications
- **Progress Tracking**: Updating documentation files after each major action

### ▶️ When to Start a New Session

**Start New Session When:**
- **Time Available**: You have 30-90 minutes for focused development work
- **Phase Transition**: Moving from one development phase to another
- **Logical Breakpoint**: Completing a major component or reaching a decision point
- **Fresh Context**: After context loss or when starting a new feature
- **Priority Change**: Shifting focus to a different project aspect

**Don't Start New Session For:**
- Quick clarifications or questions (< 15 minutes)
- Simple code reviews without implementation
- Minor documentation updates only
- Pure research or exploration tasks

### ⏹️ When to End a Session

**End Session When:**
- **Time Management**: Approaching your time limit or need a break
- **Task Completion**: Major component or feature is functionally complete
- **Decision Required**: You've reached a point needing your strategic input
- **Context Pressure**: Conversation becomes lengthy and may benefit from summarization
- **Quality Review**: Work needs validation before proceeding
- **Phase Boundary**: Ready to transition between development phases

**Session End Indicators:**
- You may want to end sessions at logical breakpoints
- You've completed 2-3 major tasks or components
- Session duration reaches 60-90 minutes of focused work
- Conversation becomes lengthy (AI can suggest summarizing, but user decides when)
- You've reached a decision point requiring your strategic input
- Quality checkpoint needed before proceeding to next phase

**⚠️ Troubleshooting Reference:** If experiencing persistent context loss or session issues, see the [Troubleshooting and Recovery Guide](#troubleshooting-and-recovery-guide) section.

### 🔄 Session Management Workflow

#### Starting a Session
```
You: "Start [phase] session"

AI: AI will read and review current status files, show priorities, and begin work
AI: AI will update ai-dev-context/SESSION_STATUS.md with session start time and initial priorities using file tools
AI: AI will load and review ai-dev-context/todo/current_todo_list.md for task status
```

#### During Session Work

```

**Mid-Session Context Check:**
```
"Quick status check: Show current phase, last completed task, and next priority from ai-dev-context/SESSION_STATUS.md"
```

**Context Loss Recovery:**
```
"Context lost - recovery protocol:
1. Read most recent ai-dev-context/SESSION_STATUS.md
2. Check ai-dev-context/PROGRESS.md for project timeline
3. Review ai-dev-context/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md for key files
4. Examine code changes since last session
5. Reconstruct current state and priorities"
```

**Session Interruption Recovery:**
```
"Resume after interruption:
- Check what was being worked on in ai-dev-context/SESSION_STATUS.md
- Review any partial changes in the codebase
- Identify what needs to be completed or rolled back
- Update status and continue from logical breakpoint"
```

### Session Resumption Protocol

**Complete Resumption Process:**
```
"Resume development session:
1. Read ai-dev-context/SESSION_STATUS.md for current state
2. Review ai-dev-context/PROGRESS.md for overall project status
3. Check ai-dev-context/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md for key documents
4. Load and review ai-dev-context/todo/current_todo_list.md for active tasks
5. Show me the next priority task from todo list and current blockers"
```

### Progress Tracking and Documentation

**Collaborative Progress Recording:**
```
"AI will help document this change in progress files when requested:
- Update ai-dev-context/PROGRESS.md with the completed task using file tools
- Add any new decisions to ai-dev-context/DECISIONS.md
- Note any open questions or blockers in ai-dev-context/ISSUES.md
- Update the current status in ai-dev-context/SESSION_STATUS.md"
```

**Todo-Based Progress Tracking:**
```
"Update todo list and session status after completing [task]:
- Mark [task] as completed in ai-dev-context/todo/current_todo_list.md
- Move completed task to ai-dev-context/todo/completed_tasks.md with timestamp
- Update ai-dev-context/SESSION_STATUS.md with completion details
- Identify and prioritize next task from todo list

- Update master ai-dev-context/PROGRESS.md with session highlights
- Reset ai-dev-context/SESSION_STATUS.md for next session"
```

### Context Window Management

**Context Management Triggers (User-Initiated):**
- **🔴 High Priority**: Very long conversations (you may want to request summarization)
- **🟠 Medium Priority**: Session duration >90 minutes (consider ending session)
- **🟡 Low Priority**: Major phase transition or key architectural decision point
- **🟢 Maintenance**: Logical task completion or quality checkpoint

**Context Management Decision Guide:**
```
You should consider context management when:
1. Conversations become very lengthy (AI can suggest summarization)
2. Session duration exceeds 90 minutes (consider ending session)
3. Major phase transitions or key decisions occur
4. Logical completion points or quality checkpoints are reached
```

**Context Summarization Support:**
```
AI can help compress context by:
1. Extracting key decisions and rationale from conversations
2. Summarizing implementation approaches and patterns used
3. Documenting file references and change summaries
4. Recording dependency relationships and constraints
5. Capturing lessons learned and best practices discovered
```

**Create Context Snapshots:**
```
"Create context snapshot for [current state]:
- Document current phase and progress
- List active tasks and priorities
- Note critical dependencies
- Archive non-essential details"
```

**When Context Window is Full:**
```
"Emergency context reset:
1. Immediately archive current ai-dev-context/SESSION_STATUS.md
2. Create ai-dev-context/PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md with key achievements
3. Archive conversation highlights
4. Start fresh with recovery command"
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### 🔧 Development Process Best Practices

1. **Always reference previous work** - Start each session by reviewing relevant documents
2. **Use specific commands** - Tell me exactly what to generate and why
3. **Break complex tasks** - Use todo lists for multi-step implementations
4. **Incremental delivery** - Aim for working functionality in each session
5. **Progressive validation** - Test and validate work incrementally rather than at the end
6. **Regular progress reports** - Use "Generate progress report" to track advancement

### 🛡️ Quality Assurance Best Practices

7. **Quality gate compliance** - Complete all Implementation Quality Gates before marking tasks as done
8. **Rigorous testing protocol** - Never implement without comprehensive testing (unit, integration, regression)
9. **Quality gate reviews** - Always review AI work against your requirements before proceeding
10. **Validate against acceptance criteria** - Ensure all work meets documented requirements

### 📝 Task and Documentation Management

11. **Todo list management** - Keep ai-dev-context/todo/current_todo_list.md synchronized with development progress and update after every task completion
12. **Prioritize systematically** - Use todo list priority levels for task management
13. **Decision documentation** - Record your decisions in ai-dev-context/DECISIONS.md with rationale for architectural choices
14. **Documentation discipline** - Never complete a task without updating relevant tracking files
15. **Cross-reference everything** - Link related documents and decisions for easy navigation

### 🕐 Session Management Best Practices

16. **Clear session boundaries** - Start and end sessions at logical breakpoints with clear goals
17. **Time-boxed sessions** - Plan for 30-90 minute focused sessions with clear objectives
18. **Strategic decision making** - Make architectural and business decisions yourself, let AI handle implementation
19. **Session hygiene** - Follow the complete session end protocol to ensure clean handoffs
20. **Know when to intervene** - Review AI work at phase transitions, make architectural decisions, approve major implementation approaches, validate against business requirements, and decide on trade-offs or compromises
21. **Let AI work independently** - Allow AI to implement approved designs, write code following specifications, create documentation, execute systematic tasks, and update progress tracking
22. **Match session length to task complexity** - Use 30-45 minutes for quick implementation tasks and documentation updates, 60-75 minutes for major component development and architecture design, and 90+ minutes for complex implementation and comprehensive testing

### 💾 Context Preservation Best Practices

23. **Systematic status updates** - Update ai-dev-context/SESSION_STATUS.md after every major action and never end a session without updating it
24. **Context window awareness** - Monitor conversation length and proactively archive context
25. **Recovery-first mindset** - Always assume sessions will be interrupted and prepare accordingly
26. **Archive regularly** - Create progress archives at logical completion points

## 🔧 Troubleshooting and Recovery Guide

### 🔨 Quick Problem Solver

**Got a problem? Use these simple commands:**

| Problem | Command | What It Does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **AI lost context** | `"Emergency recovery"` | Restores session from status files |
| **AI giving wrong answers** | `"Check hallucinations"` | Validates AI suggestions against reality |
| **AI won't stop being wrong** | `"Reset AI understanding"` | Fresh start with correct context |
| **Code partially broken** | `"Handle implementation failure"` | Rolls back or fixes broken code |
| **Documentation is messy** | `"Fix documentation corruption"` | Cleans up conflicting files |
| **AI suggests conflicting things** | `"Resolve conflicts"` | Systematically picks best option |
| **Session feels stuck** | `"Assess session restart"` | Decides whether to restart or continue |
| **Everything is broken** | `"Critical failure protocol"` | Emergency procedures |

### Common Problems & Solutions

#### 🔄 Context Loss (AI forgets what we're doing)

**Signs:**
- AI asks about things we already discussed
- References old/wrong information
- Gives generic responses

**Fix:**
```
"Emergency recovery"
```
This command makes AI read all your status files and get back on track.

#### 🤖 AI Hallucinations (AI makes things up)

**Signs:**
- Suggests code that doesn't exist
- References functions/files that aren't there
- Misunderstands your project completely

**Fix:**
```
"Check hallucinations"
```
This validates AI suggestions against your actual codebase.

#### 🔧 Broken Implementation (Code doesn't work)

**Signs:**
- Tests failing after AI changes
- Features partially working
- Breaking existing functionality

**Fix:**
```
"Handle implementation failure"
```
This assesses damage and creates a recovery plan.

#### 📄 Documentation Problems (Files don't match)

**Signs:**
- ai-dev-context/ files contradict each other
- Requirements don't match implementation
- Status files are outdated

**Fix:**
```
"Fix documentation corruption"
```
This cleans up conflicting documentation.

### When to Restart Your Session

**🔴 Restart Now:**
- AI has lost >50% of session context
- Session longer than 2 hours
- AI persistently misunderstands requirements
- Critical files corrupted

**🟡 Consider Restarting:**
- Multiple failed attempts on same task
- AI keeps changing its mind
- Documentation getting messy

**🟢 Keep Going:**
- Minor context gaps
- Single failed attempt
- AI understands but suggests variations

### Prevention Tips

**Before Starting:**
- [ ] Update ai-dev-context/SESSION_STATUS.md
- [ ] Check ai-dev-context/todo/current_todo_list.md
- [ ] Verify requirements are clear

**During Work:**
- [ ] Test frequently in small pieces
- [ ] Update documentation after major changes
- [ ] Use consistent terminology

**Before Ending:**
- [ ] Update session status
- [ ] Mark completed tasks
- [ ] Document any decisions made

### Emergency Procedures

If everything goes wrong:

1. **Stop immediately** - Don't make it worse
2. **Use `"Critical failure protocol"`** - Let AI guide recovery
3. **Document what happened** - Learn from it
4. **Start fresh if needed** - Sometimes it's faster
