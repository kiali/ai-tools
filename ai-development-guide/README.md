This AI development guide is a result of me asking "grok-code-fast-1" model the following:
---
I want you to develop a plan that I can use  in order to guide  my conversations with you - this plan should enable me to properly tell you to implement a new software component, feature, or framework. I do not know the best way you want to be guided to do this. But I want something to tell me how I can guide you across multiple sessions and context windows to go from research, to defining requirements, to planning the implementation, and finally to implementing and testing the solution. What kind of intermediate documenation should I ask you to generate? What kinds of questions and commands should I give you to get you to generate the proper tasks/commands/rules?
---
I then spend time conversing with Cursor to refine the dev guide and build it out.
